# API with ASP.NET Core MVC

This is a simple ASP.NET Core MVC project that consumes an API I developed. It is my first experience working with API integration in an MVC application.

## 🚀 Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to:
- Fetch data from a custom-built API using **HttpClient**.
- Display API data in an MVC view.
- Handle API requests and responses in a structured way.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **ASP.NET Core MVC**
- **ASP.NET Core Web API** (Custom API)
- **C#**
- **HttpClient** for API calls
- **Bootstrap / Material UI (optional)** for UI design
  
## 🔗 API Integration
- The project makes **GET requests** to my custom API using `HttpClient`.
- API response is mapped to a **C# model** and displayed in a view.

## 📌 Future Improvements
- Implement **POST, PUT, DELETE** requests.
- Add **authentication** if required.
- Improve UI and error handling.
